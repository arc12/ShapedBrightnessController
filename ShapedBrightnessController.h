/*! This is meant for use with Xmas Lights.
Purpose is to control LED brightness using PCA9685, where the brightness of each LED is
programmed to follow a particular pattern as "ticks" of time occur, additionally under
the influence of input values, that are expected to be dynamic (e.g. from user-controlled
pots, sound level sensor, LDR etc)

It keeps current values for all LEDs and manages the change of the output brightness. */
